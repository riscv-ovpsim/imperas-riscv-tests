This directory contains information an Imperas test suite.
The focus of these tests is to check the device under test complies with the RISC-V specifications.

The tests have been generated by the Imperas directed test generator.
At the top of each test source file is listed the specification version and configuration options used.

[`test_suite_details.txt`](test_suite_details.txt) provides instruction counts.

[`test_suite_sizes.txt`](test_suite_sizes.txt) has information about each test in the suite.

[`basic.coverage.txt`](basic.coverage.txt) shows functional coverage data.

The coverage data is collected and reported by functionality included in riscvOVPsim.
