# Imperas RISC-V Architecture Tests for RV64M
C Standard Extension for Compressed Integer Instructions 

This directory contains an Imperas test suite.
The focus of these tests is to check the device under test complies with the RISC-V specifications.

The tests have been generated by the Imperas directed test generator.
At the top of each test source file is listed the specification version and configuration options used.

[`test_suite_details.txt`](test_suite_details.txt) provides instruction counts.

[`test_suite_sizes.txt`](test_suite_sizes.txt) has information about each test in the suite.

[`basic.coverage.txt`](basic.coverage.txt) shows functional coverage data.

[`extended.coverage.txt`](extended.coverage.txt) includes extended functional coverage detail.

The coverage data is collected and reported by functionality included in riscvOVPsim.

The 'src' directory contains all the .S assembler files of the tests.
The 'reference' directory contains the reference signatures for the tests.
