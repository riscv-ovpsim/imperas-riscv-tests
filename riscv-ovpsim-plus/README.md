===
A Complete, Fully Functional, Configurable RISC-V Simulator
===

This directory is a placeholder for an installation of riscvOVPsimPlus.

riscvOVPsimPlus is based on the world class Imperas simulation technology and extends the functonality and capabilities of riscvOVPsim while still maintaining the easy access and free usage.

Extended features include: 
- simulation of more RISC-V instruction extensions (those that are stable close to ratification), including vectors and bitmanip
- ability to trace full instruction execution
- control memory regions
- connect to GDB debuggers and Eclipse and Imperas eGui IDE and graphical interfaces
