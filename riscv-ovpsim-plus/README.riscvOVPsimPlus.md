## Imperas Simulators
Imperas is the leading developer of RISC-V simulators for compliance testing, test development, hardware design verification, and operating system and application software development.

There are three simulators in the Imperas RISC-V range:

- the free riscvOVPsim (this simulator) from GitHub.com/riscv-ovpsim used for compliance testing and bare metal software runs
- the free riscvOVPsimPlus from OVPworld.org/riscv-ovpsim-plus (requiring registration) targeting test development and initial hardware verification
- the commercial M*SIM from Imperas Software, Inc., for professional developers, hardware design verification teams, operating system and advanced software developers.

All three simulators are based on the Imperas CpuManager simulator base technology utilizing the OVP open standard APIs, and are targeted at different uses and have different capabilities.

## About riscvOVPsim
**riscvOVPsim** is a free download from its [GitHub](https://github.com/riscv-ovpsim/imperas-riscv-tests) repository and supports only the ratified parts of the RISC-V specification.

**riscvOVPsimPlus** is available as free download (after registration) from [www.OVPworld.org/riscv-ovpsim-plus](https://www.OVPworld.org/riscv-ovpsim-plus) and supports the newer, under development standard ISA extensions and many more simulator features such as trace and debug.

The Imperas RISC-V simulators implement the full and complete functionality of the RISC-V Foundation's public User and Privilege specifications.

This riscvOVPsim simulator is a free simulator and has some restrictions.

The simulator is command line configurable to enable/disable all current optional and processor specific options. 

The simulator is developed, licensed and maintained by [Imperas Software](https://www.imperas.com/riscv) and it is fully compliant to the OVP open standard APIs. 

As a member of the RISC-V Foundation community of software and hardware innovators collaboratively driving RISC-V adoption, Imperas has developed the family of riscvOVPsim simulators to assist RISC-V adopters to become compliant to the RISC-V specifications.

riscvOVPsim includes an industrial quality model and simulator of RISC-V processors for use for compliance testing purposes. It has been developed for personal, academic, or commercial use, and the model is provided as open source under the Apache 2.0 license. The simulator is provided under the  Open Virtual Platforms (OVP) Fixed Platform Kits license that enables download and usage. Imperas actively maintains, enhances, and supports riscvOVPsim and its use. To ensure you make use of the current version of riscvOVPsim this release will expire. Please download the latest version.

 Runtime configurable settings for all enabled RISC-V specification options makes it very easy to use.

Full commercial features are provided including variant selection, RISC-V specification model configuration options, semihosting, and RISC-V compliance group signature dump facility for compliance testing.

The purpose of this **riscvOVPsim** simulator is for running compliance test programs and generating the reference signatures for comparison with devices being tested.

If you need a simulator to use for test development or any form of verification, for example: tracing, GDB/Eclipse debug, or post simulation trace/compare, then you need to use a more feature rich Imperas simulator. Please visit [www.OVPworld.org/riscv-ovpsim-plus](https://www.OVPworld.org/riscv-ovpsim-plus) to access the more advanced simulator. If you are looking for full hardware design verification solutions, such as SystemVerilog encapsulation of the reference model, step/compare/lockstep capabilities, or RISC-V verification IP solutions, then visit [www.imperas.com/riscv](https://www.imperas.com/riscv).

## Measuring Instruction Functional Coverage with the riscvOVPsim coverage engine
Instruction Functional Coverage as it relates to processor verification is a technology solution to measure what is being stimulated in the ISA in terms of which instructions, operands and values are driven into a processor.


The Imperas coverage technology is developed using the Imperas VAP intercept technology and is provided as part of riscvOVPsim.


Example coverage command:


        $ riscvOVPsim.exe --variant RVB32I --program eg.elf --cover basic --extensions I --reportfile impCov.log

The Imperas Instruction Functional Coverage works by monitoring every instruction as it retires and recording information about it.


At the end of simulation this data is summarized in the console and simulation log file.


        COVERAGE :: I :: threshold : 1 : instructions: seen 13/40 :  32.50%, coverage points hit: 262/2952 :   8.88%

Full details are provided in the report file.


You can get coverage reports for one run or merge results from many runs. You can select which instruction extension to report on, or even select just individual instructions to report on.


There is currently 'basic' and 'extended' coverage measuring.


Please read the [riscvOVPsim user guide](doc/riscvOVPsim_User_Guide.pdf) for full operational instructions.


If a signature comparison based verification methodology is adopted (as in the RISC-V Compliance suites) for comparison between device under test and reference, then functional coverage is only part of the story, as it is essential to measure the successful propagation of the results of the input instructions/values into the signature.

Read more about this in the section on Mutation Testing in the [riscvOVPsim user guide](doc/riscvOVPsim_User_Guide.pdf).


The coverage technology provided as part of riscvOVPsim has fixed functionality. The Imperas coverage technology is available as an extension library as source as a standard part of the Imperas commercial product offerings and this allows users to extend and modify functionality and coverage capability. Contact Imperas for more information.
